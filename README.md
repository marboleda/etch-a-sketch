## Languages
- HTML
- CSS

## What did I learn?
- DOM Manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- Using Grid layout in CSS

## To-Do
- Add a "disco" mode which changes color to completely random RGB value
- Add a "slow" mode which makes it so each pass adds another 10% of black to a cell so square becomes completely back only after 10 passes
- Style further with CSS
